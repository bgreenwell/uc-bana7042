## Ames housing data

* Data describing the sale of individual residential property in Ames, Iowa
from 2006 to 2010
* There are 2930 observations on 81 variables involved in assessing home
values:
  - 23 nominal
  - 23 ordinal
  - 14 discrete
  - 20 continuous
* Paper: [https://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock.pdf](https://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock.pdf)


## Ames housing data {.scrollable}

```{r}
#| echo: true
ames <- AmesHousing::make_ames()  # install.packages("AmesHousing")
ames$Sale_Price <- ames$Sale_Price / 10000
head(ames)
```


## Ames housing data

We'll focus on a handful of variables:

* `Sale_Price` - Sale price of the house / \$10K (response variable)
* `Gr_Liv_Area` - Above grade (ground) living area square feet
* `Overall_Qual⁠` - Rates the overall material and finish of the house


## Inference for a single variable {.smaller}

* Is it useful to test the hypothesis that `Sale_Price` = \$160K?

. . .

* No! Because `Sale_Price` is not a constant, but a random variable whose value varies from home to home (and year to year, etc.)

. . .

* We're more interested in questions such as:

  - What is the chance that `Sale_Price` > \$160K? (above median sale price)
  - What is the chance that `Sale_Price` < \$105K? (lowest decile)
  - What is the chance that \$129,500 < `Sale_Price` < \$213,500? (within IQR)


## Distribution of `Sale-Price`

Can look at historgram and empirical [CDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function):

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-asp: 0.5
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), las = 1)
hist(ames$Sale_Price, br = 50, xlab = "Sale price ($)", freq = FALSE, main = "")
plot(ecdf(ames$Sale_Price), xlab = "Sale price ($)", main = "",
     col = adjustcolor(1, alpha.f = 0.1))
```


## Distribution of `Sale-Price`

* Histograms and ECDFs are nonparammetric in nature
* A simple parametric approach might assume a particular distribution for `Sale_Price`
* For instance, we might assume `Sale_Price` $\sim N\left(\mu, \sigma^2\right)$
* How can we estimate $\mu$ and $\sigma$?

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true
# Maximum likelihiid estimates
c("sample mean" = mean(ames$Sale_Price), "sample stdev" = sd(ames$Sale_Price))
```

. . .

* Is the normal distribution a reasonable assumption here?


## Normal QQ plot

* Normal quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot* can be used to asses the "normalityness" of a set of observations

* Q-Q plots can, in general, be used to compare data with any distribution!

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-asp: 0.618
qqnorm(ames$Sale_Price, col = 2, las = 1)
qqline(ames$Sale_Price)
```


## Normality tests :vomiting_face: 

* Normality tests, like the [Shapiro-Wilk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapiro%E2%80%93Wilk_test)^[In R, see `?shapiro.test` for details.] and [Anderson-Darling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson%E2%80%93Darling_test) tests, can also be used to assess normality

  - I STRONGLY ADVISE AGAINST USING THEM!
  
* No data is normally distributes, what we care about is whether enough a normal approximation is close enough!

* Normality tests provide a $p$-value, which only gives a yes/no conclusion


## Normality tests :vomiting_face: 

Recall that $p$-values are a function of sample size!

```{r}
#| echo: true
# Shapiro-Wilk test results vs. sample size
set.seed(101)  # for reproducibility
x <- replicate(100, c(
  shapiro.test(rt(10, df = 40))$p.value,
  shapiro.test(rt(100, df = 40))$p.value,
  shapiro.test(rt(500, df = 40))$p.value,
  shapiro.test(rt(1000, df = 40))$p.value,
  shapiro.test(rt(2500, df = 40))$p.value,
  shapiro.test(rt(5000, df = 40))$p.value
))
rownames(x) <- paste0("n=", c(10, 100, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000))
rowMeans(x < 0.05)
```


## Normality tests :vomiting_face: 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| par: true
#| fig.width: 6
#| fig.asp: 0.618
#| out.width: "100%"
x <- seq(from = -5, to = 5, length = 500)
y1 <- dnorm(x)
y2 <- dt(x, df = 40)
# palette("Okabe-Ito")
plot(x, y1, type = "l", xlab = "", ylab = "Density")
lines(x, y2, col = 2)
legend("topleft", legend = c("Standard normal", "t (df = 40)"), lty = 1,
       col = c(1, 2), inset = 0.01, bty = "n")
# palette("default")
```

1. Are these two distributions significantly different?

2. Are these two distributions practically different?


## What can we do if the normality assumption isn't justified?

* Try transformations
  - Logarithm or square root for positive data
  - [Power transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_transform) (like the well-known Box-Cox procedure)

* Try a more appropriate distribution (e.g., Poisson or gamma distribution)

* Try more advanced nonparametric approaches, like [bootstrapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics))!


## Modeling the mean response

* Assume that $Y \sim N\left(\mu, \sigma^2\right)$, where

$$\mu = \mu\left(x\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x = E\left(Y|x\right)$$

. . .

* In other words: $Y \sim N\left(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x, \sigma^2\right)$
* Alternatively, we could write $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon$, where $\epsilon \sim N\left(0, \sigma^2\right)$
* This is called the simple linear regression (SLR) model


## The idea behind SLR

## Arsenic experiment example

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-asp: 0.618
plot(investr::arsenic, las = 1)  # see ?investr::arsenic for details
```


## Least squares (LS) estimation

Idea of LS is to find $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ so that the sum of squared residuals (i.e., errors) is minimized:
$$SSE = \sum_{i=1}^n\left(y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1x_i\right)^2$$

. . .

Pretty straightforward optimization problem that leads to closed-form solution (but no point in memorizing the formulas!)


## Concept of LS estimation

## `Sale_Price` and `Gr_Liv_Area`

```{r}
#| echo: true
plot(Sale_Price ~ Gr_Liv_Area, data = ames, las = 1)
```


## SLR fit

```{r}
#| echo: true
summary(fit <- lm(Sale_Price ~ Gr_Liv_Area, data = ames))
```


## Is this a good fit?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-asp: 0.618
plot(Sale_Price ~ Gr_Liv_Area, data = ames)
abline(fit, lwd = 2, col = 2)  # add SLR fit
```

Which assumptions seem violated to some degree?


## Residual diagnostics

* The standard residual is defined as $e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i$ and can be regarded as the *observed error*
* The residuals hold a lot of properties that make them useful for diagnosing potential issues with the model (e.g., suggesting potential transformations to try)
* Many other kinds of residuals exist for different purposes (e.g., standardized, [studentized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studentized_residual), jackknife or [PRESS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRESS_statistic) residuals, etc.)


## What can residual plots tell us?

* Residuals vs. predictor values (**checking non-linearity**).

* Residuals vs. fitted values (**non-constant variance, non-linearity, and outliers**)

* Residuals vs. time or another sequence (**checking independence**)

* Residuals vs. omitted predictor values (**missing potentially important predictors**)

* Normal QQ plot of residuals (**non-normality**).

* And much, much more!


## Residual analysis for `Sale_Price ~ Gr_Liv_Area`
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-asp: 0.618
par(mfrow = c(2, 3), las = 1)
plot(fit, which = 1:6)
```

What assumptions appear to be in violation?


## Let's try a log transformation

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-asp: 0.618
fit2 <- lm(log(Sale_Price) ~ Gr_Liv_Area, data = ames)
plot(log(Sale_Price) ~ Gr_Liv_Area, data = ames)
abline(fit2, lwd = 2, col = 2)  # add SLR fit
```


## Let's try a log transformation

```{r}
#| echo: true
summary(fit2)
```


## Residual analysis for `log(Sale_Price) ~ Gr_Liv_Area`
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-asp: 0.618
par(mfrow = c(2, 3), las = 1)
plot(fit2, which = 1:6)
```

Any better?


## Multiple linear regression

* The (normal) multiple linear regression model assumes $Y \sim N\left(\mu\left(\boldsymbol{x}\right), \sigma^2\right)$, where $$\mu\left(\boldsymbol{x}\right) = \beta_0 + \sum_{i=1}^p \beta_i x_i = \boldsymbol{x}^\top\boldsymbol{\beta}$$

* LS estimation still provides unbiased estimate of $\boldsymbol{\beta} = \left(\beta_0, \beta_1, \dots, \beta_p\right)^\top$: $\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} = \left(\boldsymbol{X}^\top\boldsymbol{X}\right)^{-1}\boldsymbol{X}^\top\boldsymbol{y}$

* Fitted values: $\hat{\boldsymbol{y}} = \boldsymbol{X}\left(\boldsymbol{X}^\top\boldsymbol{X}\right)^{-1}\boldsymbol{X}^\top\boldsymbol{y} = \boldsymbol{H}\boldsymbol{y}$

* $\boldsymbol{H}$ is the well-known "[hat matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_matrix)"


## Categorical variables

* Categorical variables can be handled in a number of ways in linear models, including

  - [Dummy encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_variable_(statistics)) (nominal)
  - Orthogonal polynomials (ordinal)


## Categorical variables

Let's look at two (nominal) categorical variables (in your homework, you'll look at `Overall_Qual`, and ordered factor with many levels):

```{r}
#| echo: true
table(ames$Central_Air)
table(ames$Paved_Drive)
```


## Categorical variables

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-asp: 0.618
plot(log(Sale_Price) ~ Central_Air, data = ames, las = 1, col = c(2, 3))
```


## Categorical variables

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-asp: 0.618
plot(log(Sale_Price) ~ Paved_Drive, data = ames, las = 1, col = c(2, 3, 4))
```

If one of these homes downgraded from a paved driveway to a gravel driveway, would that **cause** the sale price to decrease? (Think very carefully here!)


## Categorical variables

R dummy encodes nominal factors by default:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-asp: 0.618
fit3 <- lm(log(Sale_Price) ~ Gr_Liv_Area + Central_Air + Paved_Drive, 
           data = ames)
summary(fit3)
```

How do you interpret the coefficients here?


## Variable/model selection

* Variable/model selection is a very noisy problem! (Often best to avoid, if feasible)
* Ask the domain experts about important variables (don't just rely on algorithms)
* P(selecting the "right" variables) = 0 ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF1WsYZ94Es))
* "All ~~models~~ subsets of variables are wrong, but some are useful!"
* In regression settings, regularization (e.g., [ridge regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge_regression) and the [LASSO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics))) is often more useful! (Think about the impact of [multicollinearity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity) on variable selection)


## Data splitting

* If prediction is the goal (e.g., compared to inference and hypothesis testing), the model performance should be assessed rigorously

* Data splitting techniques ae key and the type of data splitting to use often depends on the situation (e.g., cross-sectional vs. time-series data)

* In simplest terms, random split the data into two parts: A and B. Build a model on part A and see how well it does with predicting the response in part B.

* [Leakage](https://reproducible.cs.princeton.edu/) is a huge concern here, so data splitting has to be done carefully!
