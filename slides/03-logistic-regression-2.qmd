## Western collaborative group study

$N = 3154$ healthy young men aged 39--59 from the San Francisco area were assessed for their personality type. All were free from coronary heart disease at the start of the research. Eight and a half years later change in this situation was recorded. See `?faraway::wcgs` in R.

```{r}
# install.packages("faraway")
head(wcgs <- faraway::wcgs)

## Exploratory data analysis

Try fitting a full model first!
```{r}
lr.fit.all <- glm(chd ~ ., family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = wcgs)#, maxit = 9999)
summary(lr.fit.all)
```


## Exploratory data analysis

Refit without *leakage* variables `typechd` and `timechd`:
```{r}
wcgs <- subset(wcgs, select = -c(typechd, timechd))
lr.fit.all <- glm(chd ~ ., family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = wcgs)#, maxit = 9999)
summary(lr.fit.all)
```


## What's going on with `dibep`?

Let's inspect the data a bit more; we'll start with a [SPLOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scatter_plot#Scatter_plot_matrices)

```{r}
#| par: true
y <- ifelse(wcgs$chd == "yes", 1, 0)
pairs(wcgs, col = adjustcolor(y + 1, alpha.f = 0.1))
```


## Check for `NA`s

The `lapply()` function (and friends) are quite useful!
```{r}
# Which columns contain missing values?
sapply(wcgs, FUN = function(column) mean(is.na(column)))
```


## [Measures of Association: How to Choose?](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8756479308317006)^[Nice little paper from Harry Khamis, my old graduate advisor at WSU.]

![](images/measures-of-association.png)


## Check pairwise correlations 

Only looking at numeric columns:
```{r}
# Look at correlations between numeric features
num <- sapply(wcgs, FUN = is.numeric)  # identify numeric columns
(corx <- cor(wcgs[, num], use = "pairwise.complete.obs"))  # simple correlation matrix
```


## Check pairwise correlations 

Only looking at numeric columns:
```{r}
#| par: true
corrplot::corrplot(corx, method = "square", order = "FPC", type = "lower", diag = TRUE)
```


## Check pairwise correlations 

Pairwise scatterplots with [LOWESS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_regression) smoothers:
```{r}
#| par: true
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(weight ~ height, data = wcgs, col = adjustcolor(1, alpha.f = 0.4))
lines(lowess(x=wcgs$height, y=wcgs$weight), lwd = 2, col = 2)
plot(dbp ~ sdp, data = wcgs, col = adjustcolor(1, alpha.f = 0.4))
lines(lowess(wcgs$sdp, y = wcgs$dbp), lwd = 2, col = 2)
```


## What about categorical variables?

[Contingency table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_table) cross-classifying `dibep` and `behave`:
```{r}
# What about categorical features?
xtabs(~ behave + dibep, data = wcgs)  # perfect correlation?
```


## So far...

* As expected, looks like there's moderate positive correlation between

  - `sdp` and `dbp`
  - `height` and `weight`

* Not necessarily a problem (yet). But how could potentially fix any issues?

* Also looks like some redunancy between the categorical variables `dibep` and `behave`


## Looking more closely at `dibep`

Try a decision tree:
```{r}
# What about categorical features?
rpart::rpart(dibep ~ ., data = wcgs)  # perfect correlation?
```

</br>

Looks like `dipep` can be predicted perfectly from `behave` (i.e., they are redundant)


## Redundancy analysis

[Redunancy analysis](https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/Hmisc/html/redun.html) is a powerful tool available in the [Hmisc]() package:
```{r}
# Notice we're ignoring the response here!
Hmisc::redun(~ . - chd, nk = 0, data = wcgs)
```


## Battery target

Cool idea from [Salford Systems](https://www.minitab.com/en-us/products/spm/) back in the day (now part of Minitab). Think of it as VIFs and redundancy analysis on steroids!

## Full model (again)

This time we've removed both the leakage and redundant predictors:
```{r}
# Refit model without leakage or redundant features
summary(lr.fit.all <- glm(chd ~ . - dibep, family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = wcgs))
```


## Variance inflation factors (VIFs)

VIFs aren't built into base R, so here we'll use the [car]() package:
```{r}
# Check (generalized) VIFs
car::vif(lr.fit.all)
```

</br>

Does anyone recall how VIFs are computed? Try running this with `dibep` still in the model!


## Body mass index = f(height, weight)

* Feature engineering is useful in cases where it makes sense!

* Not sure we can combine `sdb` and `dbp` in any useful way?!

* `height` and `weight` can be combined into a single number called [body mass index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index) (BMI): $\text{BMI} = \frac{\text{mass}_\text{lb}}{\text{height}_\text{in}^2} \times 703$

```{r}
wcgs$bmi <- with(wcgs, 703 * weight / (height^2))
head(wcgs[, c("height", "weight", "bmi")])
```


## Full model (again again)

This time, we'll remove `sdb`, `height`, and `weight`, and include `bmi`:
```{r}
summary(lr.fit.all <- update(lr.fit.all, formula = . ~ . + bmi - sdp - height - weight))
```


## Backward elimination

* [Stepwise procedures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepwise_regression) work the same here as they did for ordinary linear models

* While base R has the `step()` function, the `stepAIC()` function from package [MASS]() is a bit better:
```{r}
summary(lr.fit.back <- MASS::stepAIC(lr.fit.all, direction = "backward", trace = 0))
```


## Forward selection

Let's assume we know `cigs` is relevant for predicting `chd` (regardless of its statistical significance). So we start with that in the model:
```{r}
# Variable selection using forward selection with AIC; which variables were added?
m <- glm(chd ~ cigs, data = wcgs, 
         family = binomial(link = "logit"))
(lr.fit.forward <- MASS::stepAIC(m, direction = "forward", trace = 0))
```


## Regularized regression

* Regression coefficients are estimated under various constraints

* Most common approaches include:
  - [Ridge regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge_regression), which can be useful when dealing with [multicollinearity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicollinearity)
  - [LASSO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)), which can be useful for variable selection
  - [Elastic net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_net_regularization) (ENet) $\approx$ Ridge + LASSO

* The [glmnet]() package in R, among others, can fit the entire regularization path for many kinds of models, including GLMs and the [Cox PH model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_model)

## ENet fit to `wcgs` data

```{r}
#| par: true
library(glmnet)

# Fit an elastic net model (i.e., LASSO and ridge penalties) using 5-fold CV
wcgs.complete <- na.omit(wcgs)
X <- model.matrix(~. - chd - dibep - bmi - 1 , data = wcgs.complete)
#lr.enet <- cv.glmnet(X, y = ifelse(wcgs.complete$chd == "yes", 1, 0), 
#                     family = "binomial", nfold = 5, keep = TRUE)
lr.enet <- glmnet(X, y = ifelse(wcgs.complete$chd == "yes", 1, 0), 
                  family = "binomial")
plot(lr.enet, label = TRUE, xvar = "lambda")
```

# Model performance

## Prediction accuracy

* [Scoring rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_rule) are used to evaluate probabilistic predictions 
* A scoring rule is *proper* if it is minimized in expectation by the true probability
* It is a metric that is optimized when the forecasted probabilities are identical to the true outcome probabilities
* See [Gneiting & Raftery (2007, JASA)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/016214506000001437) and [this post](https://www.fharrell.com/post/class-damage/) for details
* Examples include [log loss](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.log_loss.html) and the [Brier score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score) (or MSE)


## Statistical classification

* A [classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification) is a model that outputs a class label, as opposed to a probabilistic prediction
* Logistic regression is NOT a classifier!!
  - Binary classification via logistic regression represents a forced choice based on a probability threshold
* Classification is rarely useful for decision making (think about a weather app that only prodiced classifications and not forecasts!)

## Classification boundary

Perfect seperation (or discrimination):
```{r}
#| par: true
# Simulate some data
N <- 200
d1 <- cbind(matrix(MASS::mvrnorm(2*N, mu = c(0, 0), Sigma = diag(2)), ncol = 2), 0)
d2 <- cbind(matrix(MASS::mvrnorm(2*N, mu = c(8, 8), Sigma = diag(2)), ncol = 2), 1)
d <- as.data.frame(rbind(d1, d2))
names(d) <- c("x1", "x2", "y")

# Fit a logistic regression
fit <- glm(y ~ ., data = d, family = binomial)

# Plot decision boundary using 0.5 threshold
pfun <- function(object, newdata) {
  prob <- predict(object, newdata = newdata, type = "response")
  label <- ifelse(prob > 0.5, 1, 0)  # force into class label
  label
}
plot(x2 ~ x1, data = d, col = d$y + 1)
treemisc::decision_boundary(fit, train = d, y = "y", x1 = "x1", x2 = "x2", 
                            pfun = pfun, grid.resolution = 999)
legend("topleft", legend = c("y = 0", "y = 1"), col = c(1, 2), pch = 1)
```


## Classification boundary

Class overlap (four possibilities in terms of classification):
```{r}
#| par: true
# Simulate some data
N <- 200
d1 <- cbind(matrix(MASS::mvrnorm(2*N, mu = c(0, 0), Sigma = diag(2)), ncol = 2), 0)
d2 <- cbind(matrix(MASS::mvrnorm(2*N, mu = c(2, 2), Sigma = diag(2)), ncol = 2), 1)
d <- as.data.frame(rbind(d1, d2))
names(d) <- c("x1", "x2", "y")

# Fit a logistic regression
fit <- glm(y ~ ., data = d, family = binomial)

# Plot decision boundary using 0.5 threshold
pfun <- function(object, newdata) {
  prob <- predict(object, newdata = newdata, type = "response")
  label <- ifelse(prob > 0.5, 1, 0)  # force into class label
  label
}
plot(x2 ~ x1, data = d, col = d$y + 1)
treemisc::decision_boundary(fit, train = d, y = "y", x1 = "x1", x2 = "x2", 
                            pfun = pfun, grid.resolution = 999)
legend("topleft", legend = c("y = 0", "y = 1"), col = c(1, 2), pch = 1)
```


## Confusion matrix

* A [confusion matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix) is a special [contingency table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_table) that describes the performance of a binary classifier
* More of a [matrix of confusion](https://www.fharrell.com/post/mlconfusion/) :scream:
* Lots of statistics can be computed from a given confusion matrix 
  - They are all improper scoring rules and can be optimized by a bogus model
  - Most are not useful for decision making IMO


## Example with `wcgs` data

```{r}
# Confusion matrix (i.e., 2x2 contingency table of classification results)
y <- na.omit(wcgs)$chd  # observed classes
prob <- predict(lr.fit.all, type = "response")  # predicted probabilities
classes <- ifelse(prob > 0.5, "yes", "no")  # classification based on 0.5 threshold
(cm <- table("actual" = y, "predicted" = classes))  # confusion matrix
```

## ROC curves

* [Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) display the tradeoff between the true positive rate (TPR or sensitivity) and false positive rate (FPR or 1 - specificity) for a range of probability thresholds 
* Invariant to monotone transformations of $\hat{p}$
* [Precision-recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall#Imbalanced_data) plots can be more informative when dealing with class imbalance (really not a problem with logistic regression or when dealing with probabilities)


## Transposed conditionals

* [Confusion of the inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_of_the_inverse): $P\left(A|B\right) \ne P\left(B|A\right)$
* [The error of the transposed conditional is rampant in research](https://www.fharrell.com/post/backwards-probs/):
  - "Conditioning on what is unknowable to predict what is already known leads to a host of complexities and interpretation problems."
* TPR and FPR (and others) are [transposed conditionals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_of_the_inverse)
$$
  \begin{align}
  TPR &= P\left(\hat{Y} = 1 | Y = 1\right) \\
  &= P\left(\text{known} | \text{unknown}\right)
  \end{align}
$$


## ROC curve (by hand)

```{r}
#| par: true
threshold <- seq(from = 0, to = 1, length = 999)
tp <- tn <- fp <- fn <- numeric(length(threshold))
for (i in seq_len(length(threshold))) {
  classes <- ifelse(prob > threshold[i], "yes", "no")
  tp[i] <- sum(classes == "yes" & y == "yes")  # true positives
  tn[i] <- sum(classes == "no"  & y == "no")  # true negatives
  fp[i] <- sum(classes == "yes" & y == "no")  # false positives
  fn[i] <- sum(classes == "no"  & y == "yes")  # false negatives
}
tpr <- tp / (tp + fn)  # sensitivity
tnr <- tn / (tn + fp)  # specificity

# Plot ROC curve
plot(tnr, y = tpr, type = "l", col = 2, lwd = 2, xlab = "TNR (or specificity)", 
     ylab = "TPR (or sensitivity)")
abline(1, -1, lty = 2)
```


## ROC curve ([pROC](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pROC) package)

Can be useful to use a package sometimes (e.g., for computing are under the ROC curve; AKA AUROC or AUC)
```{r}
#| par: true
plot(roc <- pROC::roc(y, predictor = prob))
roc
```



## Leave-one-covariate-out (LOCO) importance

A simple and intuitive way to measure the "importance" of each covariate in a model. In the simplest terms:

1. Estimate baseline performance (e.g., AUROC or Brier score)
2. For $j = 1, 2, \dots p$, refit the model without feature $x_j$ and compute the degredation to the baseline performance.
3. Sort these values in a table or plot them.

See [here](https://slds-lmu.github.io/iml_methods_limitations/pfi.html#leave-one-covariate-out-loco) for more details.


## LOCO scores for `wcgs` example

```{r}
#| par: true
wcgs <- faraway::wcgs
wcgs$bmi <- with(wcgs, weight / (height^2) * 703)
omit <- c("typechd", "timechd", "dibep", "height", "weight")
keep <- setdiff(names(wcgs), y = omit)
wcgs <- wcgs[, keep]
fit <- glm(chd ~ ., data = wcgs, family = binomial)
summary(fit)

# Leave-one-covariate-out (LOCO) method
#
# Note: Would be better to incorporate some form of cross-validation (or bootstrap)
x.names <- attr(fit$terms, "term.labels")
loco <- numeric(length(x.names))
baseline <- deviance(fit)  # smaller is better; could also use AUROC, Brier score, etc.
loco <- sapply(x.names, FUN = function(x.name) {
  wcgs.copy <- wcgs
  wcgs.copy[[x.name]] <- NULL
  fit.new <- glm(chd ~ ., data = wcgs.copy, family = binomial(link = "logit"))
  deviance(fit.new) - baseline  # measure drop in performance
})
names(loco) <- x.names
sort(loco, decreasing = TRUE)
dotchart(sort(loco, decreasing = TRUE), pch = 19)
```


## Lift charts

* Classification is a forced choice! 
* In marketing, analysts generally know better than to try to classify a potential customer as someone to ignore or someone to spend resources on
  - Instead, potential customers are sorted in decreasing order of estimated probability of purchasing a product
  - The marketer who can afford to advertise to $n$ persons then picks the $n$ highest-probability customers as targets!
* I like the idea of *cumulative gain charts* for this!


## Lift charts

Cumulative gains chart applied to `wcgs` example (`lr.fit.all`):
```{r}
#| par: true
res <- treemisc::lift(prob, y = y, pos.class = "yes")
plot(res)
```


## Probability calibration

* A probability $p$ is *well calibrated* if a fraction of about *p* of the events we predict with probability $p$ actually occur
* [Calibration curves](https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/modules/calibration.html) are the :1st_place_medal: gold standard :1st_place_medal:
* Compared to general machine learning models, logistic regression tends to return well calibrated probabilities
* For details, see [Niculescu-Mizil & Caruana (2005)](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~alexn/papers/calibration.icml05.crc.rev3.pdf) and [Kull et al. (2017)](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/electronic-journal-of-statistics/volume-11/issue-2/Beyond-sigmoids--How-to-obtain-well-calibrated-probabilities-from/10.1214/17-EJS1338SI.full) and 


## Probability calibration

The [rms](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rms) function `val.prob()` can be used for this:
```{r}
#| par: true
#| results: hide
wcgs2 <- na.omit(faraway::wcgs)
y <- ifelse(wcgs2$chd == "yes", 1, 0)
fit <- glm(y ~ cigs + height, data = wcgs2, family = binomial)
prob <- predict(fit, newdata = wcgs2, type = "response")
rms::val.prob(prob, y = y)
```
