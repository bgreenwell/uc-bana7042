# Regression for Multinomial Outcomes

## Multinomial data

* The [multinomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_distribution) is an extension of the binomial where the outcome can take on more than two values

* The categories can be nominal (e.g., have no natural ordering) or ordinal in nature (e.g., low < medium < high)

* We'll start with the case of a nominal outcome having more than two categories

* Let $Y$ be a discrete r.v. that can take on one of $J$ categories with $\left\{\mathrm{P}\left(Y = j\right) = p_j\right\}_{j=1}^J$, where $\sum_{j=1}^Jp_j=1$


## Multinomial logit model

* Similar to binary regression, we need a way to *link* the probabilities $p_j$ to the predictors $\boldsymbol{x} = \left(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_p\right)^\top$

* Need to ensure each $0 \le p_j \le 1$ and that $\sum_{j=1}^Jp_j = 1$

* Idea is similar to fitting several logistic regressions using one of the categories as the reference or baseline (say, $j = 1$)

* To that end, we define the $J-1$ logits $\eta_j = \boldsymbol{x}^\top\boldsymbol{\beta}_j = \log\left(p_j / p_1\right)$, where $j \ne 1$

* Notice we have a set of coefficients for each comparison!


## Multinomial logit model

* To ensure $\sum_{j=1}^Jp_j = 1$, we have
$$
p_i = \frac{\exp\left(\eta_i\right)}{1 + \sum_{j=2}^J\exp\left(\eta_j\right)}
$$

* This implies that $p_1 = 1 - \sum_{j=2}^Jp_j$


## 1996 National Election Study

![](images/nes96.png){fig-align="center"}


## 1996 National Election Study

* We'll consider a sample taken from a subset of the 1996 American National Election Study 

* Contained in the `nes96` data frame in the [faraway](https://cran.r-project.org/package=faraway) :package:

```{r}
str(nes96 <- faraway::nes96)
```


## 1996 National Election Study

* For simplicity, we'll consider three variables: age, education level, and income groups of each respondent

* Some of the factors are "ordered" by default; E.g., `income` (respondent's education level):
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
levels(nes96$income)
```

* Same goes for `PID` and `educ` (respondent's party identification and education, respectively)


## 1996 National Election Study

Here's a cleaned up version of the data we'll work with:
```{r}
# Condense party identification (PID) column into three categories
party <- nes96$PID
levels(party) <- c(
  "Democrat", "Democrat",
  "Independent", "Independent", "Independent", 
  "Republican", "Republican"
)

# Convert income to numeric
inca <- c(1.5, 4, 6, 8, 9.5, 10.5, 11.5, 12.5, 13.5, 14.5, 16, 18.5, 21, 23.5,
          27.5, 32.5, 37.5, 42.5, 47.5, 55, 67.5, 82.5, 97.5, 115)
income <- inca[unclass(nes96$income)]

# Construct new data set for analysis
rnes96 <- data.frame(
  "party" = party, 
  "income" = income, 
  "education" = nes96$educ, 
  "age" = nes96$age
)

# Print summary of data set
summary(rnes96)
```


## 1996 National Election Study

Let's continue with some visual exploration:
```{r}
#| par: true
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

theme_set(theme_bw())

# Aggregate data; what's happening here?
egp <- group_by(rnes96, education, party) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  group_by(education) %>% 
  mutate(etotal = sum(count), proportion = count/etotal)

# Plot results
ggplot(egp, aes(x = education, y = proportion, group = party, 
                linetype = party, color = party)) + 
  geom_line(size = 2)
```


## 1996 National Election Study

Let's continue with some visual exploration:
```{r}
#| par: true
# Aggregate data; what's happening here?
igp <- mutate(rnes96, income_group = cut_number(income, 7)) %>% 
  group_by(income_group, party) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  group_by(income_group) %>% 
  mutate(etotal = sum(count), proportion = count / etotal)

# Plot results
ggplot(igp, aes(x = income_group, y = proportion, group = party, 
                linetype = party, color = party)) +
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 45)) +
  geom_line(size = 2)
```


## 1996 National Election Study

Let's continue with some visual exploration:
```{r}
#| plot: true
# Aggregate data; what's happening here?
agp <- rnes96 %>% 
  group_by(age, party) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  group_by(age) %>% 
  mutate(etotal = sum(count), proportion = count / etotal)

# Plot results
ggplot(agp, aes(x = age, y = proportion, group = party, 
                linetype = party, color = party)) +
  geom_line(size = 1, alpha = 0.5)
```


## 1996 National Election Study

Define the following probabilities:

* $p_{d} = P\left(\text{voting democrat}\right)$;
* $p_{i} = P\left(\text{voting independent}\right)$;
* $p_{r} = P\left(\text{voting republican}\right)$,

where $p_d + p_i + p_r = 1$. Assume for now that `income` is the only independent variable of interest. 


## 1996 National Election Study

The multinomial logit model effectively fits several logits (one for every class except the baseline, which is arbitrary; here, it's democrat):

* $\log\left(p_{i} / p_{d}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \mathtt{income}\quad$ (log odds of voting independent vs. democrat);
* $\log\left(p_{r} / p_{d}\right) = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \mathtt{income}\quad$ (log odds of voting republican vs. democrat).

Here we use $\beta_i$ and $\alpha_i$ to remind us that the estimated coefficients between the two logits will be different.


## 1996 National Election Study

Multinomial logit model using all three predictors:
```{r}
library(nnet)  # install.packages("nnet")

(mfit <- multinom(party ~ age + education + income, data = rnes96, trace = FALSE))
```


## Brief digression...

* By default, R encodes ordered factors using *orthogonal polynomials*

* Ames Housing example:

```{r}
#| plot: true
ames <- AmesHousing::make_ames()
ggplot(ames, aes(x = Overall_Qual, y = Sale_Price)) +#log(Sale_Price))) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(color = Overall_Qual)) +
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 45)) 
```


## 1996 National Election Study

No $p$-values here!
```{r}
summary(mfit)
```


## 1996 National Election Study

* How do we interpret the coefficients? How about for `income`?

* All else held constant, for every :warning:one-unit increase in income:warning:, the multinomial log odds of voting republican, relative to democrat increase by 0.017.

* Gross... :nauseated_face:

* Effect plots to the rescue!


## 1996 National Election Study

Look at predicted probabilities:
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
head(probs <- predict(mfit, type = "probs"))

# Sanity check
head(rowSums(probs))
```


## 1996 National Election Study

```{r}
library(pdp)  # for partial dependence (PD) plots

# Compute partial dependence of party identification on income
pfun <- function(object, newdata) {
  probs <- predict(object, newdata = newdata, type = "probs")
  colMeans(probs)  # return average probability for each class
}
pd.inc <- partial(mfit, pred.var = "income", pred.fun = pfun)
ggplot(pd.inc, aes(x = income, y = yhat, linetype = yhat.id, color = yhat.id)) +
  geom_line(size = 2) +
  xlab("Income group midpoint (in thousands)") +
  ylab("Partial dependence")
```


## 1996 National Election Study

Can perform classification, if desired...:roll_eyes:
```{r}
table("Predicted" = predict(mfit), "Actual" = rnes96$party)
```

. . .

Ummm...majority of actual Republicans are classified as Democrats?!


## 1996 National Election Study

For kicks, try stepwise selection; since the model is based on a (multinomial) likelihood, the AIC/BIC are well-defined and the usual stepwise procedures are still valid:
```{r}
(mfit2 <- MASS::stepAIC(mfit, direction = "both", scope = list("upper" = ~.^2)))
```


## 1996 National Election Study

For comparison, fit a (default) random forest:
```{r}
set.seed(2008)  # for reproducibility
(rfo <- randomForest::randomForest(party ~ ., data = rnes96, ntree = 1000))
```


## 1996 National Election Study

Random forest results for comparison:
```{r}
#| par: true
# Construct the same PD plot as before, but using the RF model
pd <- partial(rfo, pred.var = "income", pred.fun = function(object, newdata) {
  colMeans(predict(object, newdata = newdata, type = "prob"))
})
ggplot(pd, aes(x = income, y = yhat, linetype = yhat.id, color = yhat.id)) +
  geom_line(size = 2) +
  xlab("Income (midpoint in thousands)") +
  ylab("Partial dependence") +
  geom_rug(data = data.frame("income" = quantile(rnes96$income, prob = 1:9/10)), aes(x = income), inherit.aes = FALSE)
```


# Regression for Ordinal Outcomes


# Ordinal outcomes

* Technically, party identification (`party`) is ordinal variable: `Democrat` < `Independent` < `Republican`

* With an ordered response (e.g., Likert scale), it's often easier to work with the [*cumulative probabilities*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function) $p_j^\le = \mathrm{P}\left(Y \le j\right)$

* Note that if the $J$ response categories have order $1 < 2 < \cdots < J$, then $p_J^\le = \mathrm{P}\left(Y \le J\right) = 1$

* Suppose $Z$ is some unobserved (i.e., [latent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_and_observable_variables)) response but we only observe a discretized version of the form $Y = j$ if $\alpha_{j-1} < Z < \alpha_j$


## Ordinal outcomes

* If $Z - \boldsymbol{x}^\top\boldsymbol{\beta}$ has distribution $F$, then
$$
\mathrm{P}\left(Y \le j\right) = \mathrm{P}\left(Z \le \alpha_j\right) = F\left(\alpha_j - \boldsymbol{x}^\top\boldsymbol{\beta}\right)
$$

* If, for example, $F$ is a standard logistic distribution, then
$$
p_j^\le = \frac{\exp\left(\alpha_j - \boldsymbol{x}^\top\boldsymbol{\beta}\right)}{1 + \exp\left(\alpha_j - \boldsymbol{x}^\top\boldsymbol{\beta}\right)}
$$
which is a logit model for the cumulative probabilities!

* Choosing a standard normal distribution for $F$ would lead to a probit model for the cumulative probabilities, and so on...


## Proportional odds (PO) model

* Let $p_j^\top = \mathrm{P}\left(Y \le j|\boldsymbol{x}\right)$

* The standard PO model, which uses a logit link, is
$$
\log\left(\frac{p_j^\le}{1-p_j^\le}\right) = \alpha_j - \boldsymbol{x}^\top\boldsymbol{\beta}, \quad j = 1, 2, \dots, J-1
$$


## Proportional odds (PO) model

* PO assumption, etc...


## 1996 National Election Study

The simplest implementation is `polr()` from [MASS](https://cran.r-project.org/package=MASS)
```{r}
library(MASS)

(pofit <- polr(party ~ age + education + income, data = rnes96))
```


## 1996 National Election Study

Similar to before, we can use AIC-based stepwise procedures:
```{r}
(pofit2 <- stepAIC(pofit, direction = "both"))
```


## 1996 National Election Study

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
cbind(
  "deviance" = c("PO" = deviance(pofit2), "Multi" = deviance(mfit2)),
  "nparam" = c("PO" = pofit2$edf, "Multi" = mfit2$edf)
)
```


## 1996 National Election Study

Compare full and reduced model using LR test
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
anova(pofit2, pofit, test = "Chisq")
```


## 1996 National Election Study

Interpreting the coefficients:
```{r}
#| code-fold: false
summary(pofit2)
```

We can say that the odds of moving from Democrat to Independent/Republican (or from Democrat/Independent to Republican) increase by a factor of $\exp\left(0.013120\right) = 1.0132$ per unit increase in income.


## Non-proportional odds (NPO) model

* We can generalize the PO model by allowing the coefficients to vary between categories (similar to the mulinomial logit model form earlier):
$$
\log\left(\frac{p_j^\le}{1-p_j^\le}\right) = \alpha_j - \boldsymbol{x}^\top\boldsymbol{\beta}_j, \quad j = 1, 2, \dots, J-1
$$

* This relaxes the PO assumptions but requires more complicated software (e.g., the [VGAM](https://cran.r-project.org/package=VGAM) package)

* Careful, different packages use different default parameterizations; E.g., [see Table 2 here](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2018/RJ-2018-004/RJ-2018-004.pdf)


## 1996 National Election Study

PO and NPO fits to election data using [VGAM](https://cran.r-project.org/package=VGAM):
```{r}
library(VGAM)

(pofit <- vglm(party ~ income, data = rnes96,
               family = cumulative(parallel = TRUE, reverse = TRUE)))
(npofit <- vglm(party ~ income, data = rnes96,
                family = cumulative(parallel = FALSE, reverse = TRUE)))
```


## Assigning scores

*  When the ordinal response has a larger number of categories, it may be reasonable to assign scores (i.e., integers) to each level and then model these scores using a standard linear model

* Rule of thumb from my old advisor was 10 or more categories
