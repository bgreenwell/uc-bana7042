For the multiple linear regression model $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1i} + \beta_2 X_{2i} + \dots + \beta_p X_{p-1, i} + \epsilon_i$

**Question 16:** (2 pts.) Recall that the variance inflation factor for $X_j$ is defined as $VIF_j = \left(1 - R_j^2\right)^{-1}$. Explain in one sentence what $R_j^2$ is. Explain in one sentence why it is better to use VIFs than pairwise correlations when trying to detect the presence of multicollinearity in a regression data set.


**Question 17:** (2 pts.) For variable selection criteria based on residuals, among $PRESS$, $SSE$, $R^2$, $R_{adj}^2$, and $MSE$, which are "good" criteria for variable selection? Explain your reason in two sentences.


**Question 18:** (4 pts.) Please state one possible violation of normal linear regression model assumptions for each of the residual plots below (one sentence for each plot):

df1 <- tibble::tibble(

**Question 19:** (4 pts.) Suppose you want to build a linear regression for response variable weight ( $Y$ ) using covariate height ( $X_1$ ) and gender ( $X_2 = 0$ for female and $X_2 = 1$ for male).

a. Suppose you want to allow the slope (of height) to be the same for different gender but different intercept, how would you build the linear regression model? Please specify the model in one line.

b. Suppose you want to allow both slope (of height) and intercept to be different for different gender, how would you build the linear regression model? Please specify the model in one line.


**Question 20:** (2 pts.) An engineer has stated: "Reduction of the number of candidate explanatory variables should always be done using the objective forward stepwise regression procedure." Discuss.


**Question 21:** (4 pts.) A junior investment analyst used a polynomial regression model of relatively high order in a research seminar on municipal bonds and obtained an $R^2$ of 0.991 in the regression of net interest yield of bond ( $Y$ ) on industrial diversity index of municipality ( $X$ ) for seven bond issues. A colleague, unimpressed, said: "You overfitted. Your curve follows the random effects in the data." Comment on the colleague's criticism.


**Question 22:** (4 pts.) In a regression study of factors affecting learning time for a certain task (measured in minutes), gender of learner was included as a predictor variable ($X_2$) that was coded $X_2 = 1$ if male and $X_2 = 0$ if female. It was found that the estimated coefficient of $X_2$ was $\widehat{\beta}_2 = 22.3$ with a standard error of 3.8. An observer questioned whether the coding scheme for gender is fair because it results in a positive coefficient, leading to longer learning times for males than females. Comment.


**Question 23:** (2 pts.) A student stated: "Adding predictor variables to a regression model can never reduce $R^2$, so we should include all available predictor variables in the model." Comment.


**Question 24:** (2 pts.) Evaluate the following statement: "For the least squares method to be fully valid, it is required that the distribution of $Y$ be normal."


**Question 25:** (2 pts.) What is a residual? Why are residuals important in regression analysis?


**Bonus:** (5 pts.) An analyst wanted to fit the regression model $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1i} + \beta_2 X_{2i} + \dots + \beta_p X_{p-1, i} + \epsilon_i$ by the method of least squares when it is known that $\beta_2 = 4$. How can the analyst obtain the desired fit using standard statistical software (e.g., R, Python, or SAS)? No need to run any code, just describe in general how you could accomplish this.
