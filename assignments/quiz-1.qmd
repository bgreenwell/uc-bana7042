# Part I: Multiple Choice (1 point each)

**Question 1:** In the simple linear regression model $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \varepsilon_i$, which component represents the random error term?

a. $Y_i$
b. $\beta_0$
c. $\beta_1$
d. $\varepsilon_i$

**Question 2:** What is the possible range of Pearson's correlation coefficient $r$?

a. $0 \leq r \leq 1$
b. $-1 \leq r \leq 1$
c. $-\infty < r < \infty$
d. $0 < r < \infty$

**Question 3:** A high correlation between variables $X$ and $Y$ indicates that:

a. $X$ causes $Y$
b. $Y$ causes $X$
c. There is a strong linear association between $X$ and $Y$
d. There is no relationship between $X$ and $Y$

**Question 4:** The residual for observation $i$ in a regression model is defined as:

a. $\hat{Y}_i - Y_i$
b. $Y_i - \hat{Y}_i$
c. $Y_i - \bar{Y}$
d. $\hat{Y}_i - \bar{Y}$

**Question 5:** In the simple linear regression model, which of the following is assumed to be normally distributed?

a. The predictor variable $X$
b. The response variable $Y$
c. The error terms $\varepsilon_i$
d. The regression coefficients $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$

**Question 6:** Log transformations are commonly used in regression to address:

a. Missing data
b. Multicollinearity between predictors
c. Non-constant variance (heteroscedasticity) and/or nonlinearity
d. Small sample sizes

**Question 7:** Homoscedasticity in regression means:

a. The errors have different variances across all levels of $X$
b. The errors have constant variance across all levels of $X$
c. The predictors are uncorrelated
d. The response variable is normally distributed

**Question 8:** The primary purpose of $k$-fold cross-validation is to:

a. Estimate the regression coefficients
b. Test for multicollinearity
c. Assess the model's predictive performance on unseen data
d. Transform non-normal variables

# Part II: Short Answer (2 points each)

**Question 9:** In one sentence, explain what it means if a regression model has $R^2 = 0.75$.

**Question 10:** What does a funnel-shaped pattern in a residual vs. fitted values plot suggest about the regression model?

**Question 11:** Give one example of a situation when linear regression would NOT be appropriate for modeling a relationship.

**Question 12:** Why should we generally avoid fitting very high-order polynomial regression models (e.g., degree 10 or higher)?
