# IX. Duo Multi-Factor Authentication

To reduce data security risks posed by phishing to students, faculty, and staff, the University implemented two-factor authentication (Duo) across most of its systems, including Canvas. In order to access this class's course materials in Canvas, all students will need to enroll in Duo multi-factor authentication. [To enroll in Duo multi-factor authentication, please follow these instructions](https://ituc.service-now.com/kb?sys_kb_id=deb3ede91b10501047c6a6c6bc4bcbb9&id=kb_article_view&sysparm_rank=1&sysparm_tsqueryId=c5d1c387dbf0a5146403fae4e29619cc). The Office of Information Security recommends using the Duo Mobile app on your smartphone for the quickest, most user-friendly experience. [Please see the FAQ on this page for a list of alternate options for accessing Duo that do not involve needing a smartphone](https://www.uc.edu/infosec/services/two-factor-authentication.html).  

If you do not have access to your phone or other two-factor device, please contact the Lindner IT Service Desk at (513) 556-7159 to obtain a bypass code that will let you log in to Canvas. This code will allow you to log in once. 

# X. Course Communication: 

**We will exclusively use Microsoft Teams for all course communication.** Join our course Teams channel here: [IS4010 Course Team](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3ASjdonOkpgQOXFJf6qmHIWfJIwzgKl-xvmnkNVUkg8k81%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=5c3ca09e-ec41-473c-8395-ab28de92a041&tenantId=f5222e6c-5fc6-48eb-8f03-73db18203b63)

Students are strongly encouraged to:
- **Post questions to the General chat** - Your classmates likely have similar questions and can benefit from the discussion
- **Direct message me** for private concerns or individual questions
- **Check Teams regularly** for announcements, updates, and peer discussions

This is the fastest way to get help and stay connected with the class community. While university policy requires email as the primary communication method, Teams will be our primary platform for day-to-day course interactions. 

# XI. Course and Grading Policies:

## **Course Structure:** 

Changes to the syllabus, due dates, course requirements or grading requirements will be made as far in advance as possible. Due dates will be clearly marked in Canvas. All assignments will be submitted via GitHub repositories with links provided in Canvas.

## **Academic Integrity & AI Policy:** 

As with all Lindner College of Business efforts, in this course you will be held to the highest ethical standards, critical to building character. This course operates on a modern principle: **use AI, but use it wisely.** The use of AI tools like [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) and [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) is not only permitted but encouraged. However, the goal is for *you* to learn.

1. **You are the pilot, AI is the co-pilot.** You are ultimately responsible for every line of code you submit
2. **Always understand the code.** If you use AI to generate something, you must be able to explain what it does, how it works, and why it's the correct solution
3. **Acknowledge your partner.** In your final project, you will be required to document how you used AI tools in your development process

Submitting code you do not understand is considered academic misconduct. The Lindner College of Business "Two Strikes Policy" is in effect:

* All academic programs at the Lindner College of Business use this "Two Strikes Policy"; Any student who has been found responsible for two cases of academic misconduct may be dismissed from the College
* All cases of academic misconduct (e.g., copying other student's assignments, failure to adequately cite or reference, cheating, plagiarism, falsification, etc.) will be formally reported by faculty; and   
* Students will be afforded due process for allegations as outlined in the policy

## **Accessibility Resources:** 

The University of Cincinnati provides reasonable accommodation to students with disabilities through the Accessibility Resources office. Accommodations can ensure equal access and provide individualized support for students with diagnosed disabilities. If you have a disability that may influence your performance in this course, you must meet with the Accessibility Resources Office to arrange for reasonable accommodations to ensure an equitable opportunity to meet the course requirements. You can email AccessResources@uc.edu, call 513-556-6823, or stop by the Commons Edge North pavilion (near Daniels/Dabny Hall) to initiate the accommodation process. 

## **Religious Accommodations (Testing your Faith Act):**

Ohio law and the University's Student Religious Accommodations for Courses Policy 1.3.7 permits a student, upon request, to be absent for reasons of faith or religious or spiritual belief system or to participate in organized activities conducted under the auspices of a religious denomination church, or other religious or spiritual organization and/or to receive alternative accommodations with regard to examinations and other course requirements due to an absence permitted for the above-described reasons. Not later than fourteen days after the first day of instruction in the course, a student should provide the instructor with written notice of the specific dates for which the student requests alternative accommodations. [For additional information about this policy, please see The Office of the Provost's page](https://mailuc.sharepoint.com/sites/Provost/SitePages/Student-Religious-Accommodations-for-Courses.aspx).

## **Counseling Services, Clifton Campus:** 

Students have access to counseling and mental health care through the [University Health Services](http://med.uc.edu/uhs/) (UHS), which can provide both psychotherapy and psychiatric services. In addition, students can receive three free professional counseling sessions upon request through the [Counseling and Psychological Services](http://www.uc.edu/counseling.html) (CAPS). These sessions are not associated with student's insurance coverage. Students are encouraged to seek assistance for anxiety, depression, trauma/assault, adjustment to college life, interpersonal/relational difficulty, sexuality, family conflict, grief and loss, disordered eating and body image, alcohol and substance abuse, anger management, identity development and issues related to diversity, concerns associated with sexual orientation and spirituality concerns, as well as any other issue or concern. After hours, students may call UHS at (513) 556-2564 or CAPS Cares at (513) 556-0648. For urgent physician consultation after-hours students may call (513) 584-7777.

### Let's Talk

In addition to counseling sessions, CAPS offers "Let's Talk sessions for students who just want to try out speaking to someone. "Let's Talk is not therapy. It is a free, confidential, 15-20 minute consultation with a CAPS clinician. Clinicians will listen to your concerns and offer support, information, and resources. [Learn more about Let's Talk and see the current schedule here](https://www.uc.edu/campus-life/caps/support/counselor/let-s-talk.html). " 

## **Counseling Services at Lindner:**

UC has many resources that can support you on your academic journey. One resource that I would like to share with you is Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS). Dr. LaSondra Wayne is Lindner's embedded mental health clinician. CAPS provides mental health consultations, individual counseling, group counseling, crisis support and self-help tools to our students. Dr. Wayne supports our students with a variety of needs and experiences such as stress, anxiety, relationship concerns, depression, adjustment to college, learning difficulties and more. Meetings can be in person or via telehealth. Her office is located on the second floor, room 2381. To schedule an appointment with Dr. Wayne, please call 513-556-0648. Learn more about Dr. Wayne on the CAPS website or find her [on the Lindner website here](https://business.uc.edu/student-experience/caps.html).  

## **Title IX:** 

Title IX is a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance. Title IX also addresses instances of sexual violence, dating or domestic violence, and stalking. If a student discloses a Title IX issue to me, I am required to forward that information to the Title IX Office. The Title IX Office will follow up with the student about how the University can take steps to address the impact on the student and the community. They will also inform the student of their rights and direct them to available resources. The priority is to make sure students are safe and successful here at the University of Cincinnati. Students are not required to talk to anyone in the Title IX Office. Students may also directly report any instances of sex-based discrimination, harassment or violence to the Title IX office at (513) 556-3349. Students who wish to know more about their rights and resources on campus can consult the Title IX website or contact the Title IX office directly at (513) 556-3349.

[Reports may be filed](https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?UnivofCincinnati&layout_id=10) through the Title IX Office website.

## **Missed and/or late examinations, quizzes, and graded exercises:** 

Late submissions will be penalized 10% per calendar day unless prior arrangements have been made with the instructor. Since labs are due on Sundays at 11:59 PM, late penalties begin Monday morning. Extensions may be granted for documented emergencies or health issues. All requests for extensions must be made before the due date when possible.

## **LCB Weather Related and Emergency Protocol:** 

When inclement weather threatens the safety of the University of Cincinnati community, the Senior Vice President for Administration and Finance may invoke University Rule [3361: 10-55-01](http://www.uc.edu/content/dam/uc/trustees/docs/rules_10/10-55-01.pdf) and declare an emergency closing. There will be an announcement posted on Canvas and if possible, on the local news channels (TV and radio). Communications related to University closures will also be sent to the student's cell phone number on record through the automatic University emergency text messaging system. Students should notify the University if they change their cell phone number to ensure they will receive these important emergency communications. 

The Lindner College of Business will observe the university emergency closing protocol for all on-campus classes. During a university emergency closing, all college offices will be closed. 

Students should clarify with their course instructors how the closure will affect assignments and deadlines, and whether class information from the missed session(s) will be posted on Canvas, and/or if the class will meet virtually during the closure. 

***In the event of inclement weather and the university is closed, the closure will not affect online courses. All course assignments and activities will remain as scheduled in the course syllabus.***

**Criteria for letter grades:**   
Your course grades will be based on your performance on the following:

### Point Allocation:

| Assignment | Points | Weight |
|------------|--------|--------|
| Labs (14 labs × 10 pts each) | 140 | 80% |
| Final exam/project | 35 | 20% |
| **Total** | **175** | **100%** |

### Grading Scale

94% and above = A  
90% = A-	87% = B+	84% = B  
80% = B-	77% = C+	74% = C  
70% = C-	60% = D	Below 60% = F

### Description of Major Assignments

#### *Labs (80%)*

Students will complete 14 hands-on lab assignments (10 points each) that progress from basic [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming through advanced [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) development.
