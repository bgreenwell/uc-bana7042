# I. Course Information:

***Title:*** BANA 7042: Statistical Modeling    
***Course #:*** BANA 7042   
***Credit Hours:*** 2   
***Term:*** Spring 2026   
***Prerequisites:*** BANA 7038

# II. Course Description:

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to statistical modeling techniques essential for business analytics and data science. Moving beyond basic linear models, students will explore advanced regression techniques for binary, categorical, and count data. The curriculum focuses on both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of these models using the R programming language. Key topics include linear regression review, logistic regression (binary, multinomial, and ordinal), and count regression models (Poisson and Negative Binomial).

# III. Student Learning Outcomes:

Upon successful completion of this course, the learner will be able to:

*   Construct and interpret linear regression models for continuous outcomes.
*   Apply logistic regression techniques to model binary outcomes and evaluate model performance using ROC curves and calibration plots.
*   Analyze data with multiclass outcomes using multinomial and ordinal logistic regression models.
*   Model count data using Poisson and Negative Binomial regression techniques.
*   Diagnose model fit and check assumptions for various generalized linear models (GLMs).
*   Implement statistical models using R and effectively communicate results to technical and non-technical audiences.

The course uses [Canvas](https://uc.instructure.com) for grade tracking, and [GitHub](https://github.com/) for assignment submissions.

# IX. Duo Multi-Factor Authentication

To reduce data security risks, the University implemented two-factor authentication (Duo). Please ensure you are enrolled to access Canvas and other university systems.

# X. Course Communication: 

**We will exclusively use Microsoft Teams for all course communication.** 

# XI. Course and Grading Policies:

## **Course Structure:** 

Changes to the syllabus, due dates, course requirements or grading requirements will be made as far in advance as possible. Due dates will be clearly marked in Canvas.

## **Missed and/or late examinations, quizzes, and graded exercises:** 

Late submissions will be penalized 10% per calendar day unless prior arrangements have been made with the instructor.

## **Grading Scale**

94% and above = A  
90% = A-	87% = B+	84% = B  
80% = B-	77% = C+	74% = C  
70% = C-	60% = D	Below 60% = F
